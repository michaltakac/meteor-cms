# Accessing admin panel
Create account with `test@meteorpress.com` email address and you'll be able to access admin panel

# TODO
- Try to implement markdown editor like [this one](https://github.com/jshimko/meteor-ghostdown).
- Get inspired by Percolate studio's [meteor blog](https://github.com/percolatestudio/ground-control).
- Refractor useraccounts:flow-routing, it should be easy... [repo link](https://github.com/meteor-useraccounts/flow-routing)
